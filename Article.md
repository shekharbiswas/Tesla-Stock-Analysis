# What made TESLA a 300 Billion company

<br>

* BMW           - **$41 billion**
* Honda         - **$46 billion**
* Volkswagen    - **$74 billion**
* Ford          - **$24 billion**
* Ferrari       - **$32 billion**
* General Motors- **$36 billion**
* Fiat Chrysler - **$20 billion**

<br>

<br>
<br>

* Tesla         - **$300 billion !**

<br>

Your turn to do the math.

<br>
With no surprise, Tesla became the most valued car company on the planet on 13th July, 2020. It surpassed the combined market value of BMW, VW, GM and many other rivals.

However, it is not that clear that it can be considered a success or not. There are many reasons:
<br>

* Tesla is still in red in terms of Income and Revenue.

<br>
<br>

* Many people believe that the electric cars sold by TESLA are sold at low market price which even does not cover the manufacturing cost and this is success mantra for TESLA.

<br>

* To sustain the current growth TESLA would have to sell a million cars a year! Certainly, this is too much if we look at current sales volume.



<br>
<br>


However, when people talk about TESLA, they really appreciate the products manufactured by TESLA for their **cutting edge technology**. 
<br>

The cars are launched after lots of **market research** and **R&D in car design** and this is certainly one of the most important reason behind this craze about Tesla.
<br>

Hence, it would be better to call it Popularity, rather Success!

<br>

It does not mean there are not times when EU sales crossed US sales mark, due to  few countries in EU (mainly Germany, Norway and Netherlands).
