# TESLA: Story of a 300 Billion carmaker!

<br>

* BMW           - **$41 billion**
* Honda         - **$46 billion**
* Volkswagen    - **$74 billion**
* Ford          - **$24 billion**
* Ferrari       - **$32 billion**
* General Motors- **$36 billion**
* Fiat Chrysler - **$20 billion**

<br>
..
<br>
..
<br>
<br>

* Tesla         - **$300 billion !**

<br>

Your turn to do the math.

<br>
With no surprise, Tesla became the most valued car company on the planet on 13th July, 2020. It surpassed the combined market value of BMW, VW, GM and many other rivals.

However, it is not that clear that it can be considered a success or not. There are many reasons:
<br>

* Tesla is still in red in terms of Income and Revenue.


<br>

<br>

* Many people believe that the electric cars sold by TESLA are sold at low market price which even does not cover the manufacturing cost and this is success mantra for TESLA.

<br>

* To sustain the current growth TESLA would have to sell a million cars a year! Certainly, this is too much if we look at current sales volume.



<br>
<br>


However, when people talk about TESLA, they really appreciate the products manufactured by TESLA for their **cutting edge technology**. 
<br>

The cars are launched after lots of **market research** and **R&D in car design** and this is certainly one of the most important reason behind this craze about Tesla.
<br>

Hence, it would be better to call it Popularity, rather Success.



## Tesla Sales Performance in US Market

Tesla performed quite well in US market.

![us_stock_tesla](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/Tesla-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/images/1.png)


* Tesla grew **200% in 2017** and **300% in 2018**. It's nothing less than an incredible achievement!

## Tesla Sales Performance in EU Market

Probably, you have guessed it already and you're right.

Tesla sales in EU is not that astonishing.

![us_vs_eu](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/Tesla-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/images/3.png)


It does not mean there are not times when EU sales crossed US sales mark.

The credit goes to few countries in EU (mainly Germany, Norway and Netherlands which combinedly account for more than 50% sales in EU ).

![eu_beats_us](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/Tesla-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/images/eubeatus.png)

Clearly, in lase 2019 and early 2020, the sales in EU crossed US sales by sales volume.

### Sales breakdown across EU countries

* Norway has been a very progressive country in terms of welcoming green energy and reducing carbon emission for long. In 2016, Norway itself accounted for 1/4th of total sales of Tesla across the EU!

* In 2017, sales is Norway even grew more accounting for more than 1/3rd EU sales! Germany became 2nd best market.

* In 2018, sales in Netherlands grew surprisingly well and they caught up with Norway in terms of sales figure.

![2018](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/Tesla-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/images/6.png)


Well let's get into what happened in Netherlands in that time frame.

In 2018, Dutch government announced **4% benefit-in-kind (BiK) tax** on all-electric cars. 

And in 2018, there was no limit on car price. So,you get the benefit even if the car costs 100K. If you have to pay a tax of 4% instead of 22%, it is no wonder a huge attraction for masses which showed the result.

However, as we can see below, the plan is to increase it to 8% till 50K in 2020 and 12% in 2021.


* 2018: 4%

* 2019: 4% up to a maximum of €50,000 (22% for the amount above)

* 2020: 8% up to a maximum of €45,000 (22% for the amount above)

* 2021: 12% up to a maximum of €40,000 (22% for the amount above)


**So, what will happen now ?**

electric car sellers have to come up with low price models so that people still can benefit from it. 

As we know, Tesla came up with budget models like **model 3** to take the benefit of it. And results showed it. It became the world's best selling [plug-in-electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle) car in 2018, 2019.


## Tesla Stock Performance

On 13th July, Tesla stock price touched the highest valuation crossing $1790 mark making it a 300 billion USD company.

Let's have a look:

![tesla_stock](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/Tesla-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/images/10.png)

However, if someone tries to match this huge growth of stock valuation with sales parameter, it shows us some other story:

It is quite visible from sales figures that the growth of sales in 2019 end and early 2020 is quite lesser than that of 2018 end as Last quarter of 2018 had been a huge growth period for Tesla (Model 3, no doubt, was a driving force behind that). 

However, the stock peaked in early or mid-2020. It clearly shows how people's expectations have grown over time without the growth on paper.
This is not bad and happens most often with public sentiment. 

At the same time, it makes a stock overpriced and stock tries to pull back quite often in the short-run.

A closer look will show:

![tesla_closer_stock](https://github.com/shekharbiswas/Tesla-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/images/11.JPG)


In the next 5 trading sessions, Tesla stock came down to 1500 level from 1750 level. Also, it saw quite buyback activity whenever stock went below 1500, which is definitely a strong reason for people's huge expectation from Tesla's vision in general.

If I have to trust the forecast for next few months, I would put a cautious note on fresh entry to Tesla stock as it seems quite heavy on pocket and valuation wise as well.

As the forecast shows, it would remain more closer to 1400 level than 1700+ levels for next trading sessions.


I would conclude with this quote of Elon Musk:

**"We will not stop until every car on the road is electric"**

Tesla stock would then have only a trend. 

Yes you are right!
